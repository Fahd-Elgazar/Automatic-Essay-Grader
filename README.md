# Automatic-Essay-Grader
This project builds an Automatic Essay Grading system that predicts the numerical score of a student-written essay using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to create a robust and scalable model that can evaluate essay quality similarly to a human assessor.
